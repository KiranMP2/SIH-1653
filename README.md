## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
AI-Driven Question Generation & Automated Follow-up:
AI can analyze the candidate's responses in real-time and dynamically generate follow-up questions based on the strength of their answers. For instance, if a candidate shows expertise in a particular area, the AI can ask deeper, more technical questions in that domain, or conversely, shift to different areas where the candidate shows potential. 

Focus on Strengths:
Rather than only focusing for weaknesses or gaps in knowledge, the AI-driven system prioritizes questions that allow candidates to demonstrate their strongest areas of expertise. By asking more targeted questions aligned with the candidateâ€™s background, the system ensures that their full range of skills is captured, giving them the opportunity to shine in their areas of strength.

Unbiased Review:
AI removes human biases from the evaluation process by scoring both questions and responses based purely on their relevance and quality, not on personal judgment or subjective opinions. This ensures fairness in assessment, where all candidates are evaluated on equal grounds, based on their knowledge and responses rather than any external factors like background or personality.

Post-Interview Evaluation:
The system generates an overall score for the candidate based on their performance, using both question relevance and response analysis.
Experts may also add subjective feedback, but the primary decision-making is driven by objective scoring.

This approach helps recruiters and interviewers identify the most suitable candidates while maintaining fairness, objectivity, and efficiency throughout the recruitment process.
